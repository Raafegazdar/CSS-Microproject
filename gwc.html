                                <p>The Great Wall of China was built over a period of more than 2,000 years, with construction starting as early as the 7th century BCE and continuing through various dynasties. Significant portions, especially the most well-known sections, were built during the Ming Dynasty in the 14th to 17th centuries (1368–1644 CE).</p>

                                <p>The construction of the Great Wall of China was incredibly costly, both in resources and human labor. It is estimated that millions of workers, including soldiers, peasants, and prisoners, were involved in its construction over several centuries. The human cost was immense, with many laborers dying due to the harsh conditions. While exact financial costs are unknown, the immense scale of the project required substantial state resources, reflecting its importance to the Chinese emperors.</p>
